					As initially for every project I ask few research questions
					from myself to better understand the context. Here are some
					questions I wanted to get answers by the end of this project
					-
				</p>
				<ul class="margin-l20">
					<li>Current apps or services used by users.</li>
					<li>
						Users experience while using the existing products in
						the market.
					</li>
					<li>
						Challenges faced by users while using those
						applications.
					</li>
					<li>
						What are some issues users might face while buying any
						product ?
					</li>
					<li>What values I can provide to the users ?</li>
					<p style="margin-top: 30px">
						Based on these questions, I conducted a survey and 1-1
						interviews to understand the problems and pain points.
						But before that first I categorise my users, their
						geographical area and all.
					</p>
					<ul class="margin-l40">
						<li>
							<strong> Target Users -</strong> People from diverse
							backgrounds either could be
							<span class="blue"
								>teenager, middle aged people</span
							>
							and even <span class="blue">kids</span> too but
							their source of purcahsing would be their parents
							only.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong> Surveys -</strong> In this my main focus
							was to gather as much as data possible and
							understand the basic needs of my user group. So I
							generated a google form and float it in my class
							groups to obtain the data and within few hours got
							data from around 35 folks.
							<span class="blue">(Quantitative)</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong> Semi-Structured Interviews -</strong> Now
							here I talk 1-1 with my friends who recently buyed
							some eyewear products and got to know their views.
							<span class="blue">(Qualitative)</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong> Competitor Reviews -</strong>
							Best way to understand pain points of the users is
							to learn from what competitors won‚Äôt able to provide
							and then after analysing solve that issue for your
							user.

					Now particularly I had the data, but that data is not

					<li>
						Hard to find
						<span class="blue">customised frames</span> on
						local/online stores.
					</li>
					<li>
						After buying the product user uninstalled the
						application (Chance to improve it‚Äôs UX by adding
						gamification).

					<li>
						User is <span class="blue">worried</span> about the

					Now comes the challenging and one of the interesting part of
					the whole design process, here comes the part when I really
					started making any prodcut for the end user. I always make
					use of <span class="blue">Pen & Paper</span> for all kind of
					brainstorming, because it gives me ample space & time to
					iterate more and more.

				<p>
					Here is a simple architecture that I made, so that I had a

					After making this, now turn comes to making

					without moving to the final visual design and I can iterate

								In the first frame as you can see the home
								screen of the application, here my main motive
								is to
								<span class="blue">categorise and sort</span>
								things beautifully as main concern of users is
								there are a lot of choices available, but
								difficult to select
								<span class="green">(Problem Solved)</span> .
							</li>
							<li>
								By Clicking on ‚ÄúEye-Glasses‚Äù as you can see a
								modal comes out, asking the user for customised
								or company‚Äôs choice product.
							</li>
							<li>
								If user goes with compnay choices, user can see
								the different products available, here again I
								try to make sorting easy, as from research I got
								to know that users make
								<span class="blue"
									>sorting more on the basis of type of
									frames</span
								>, so I try to give more priority to it.
							</li>
							<li>
								Also, I had given each product a
								<span class="blue">unique ID</span>, reason
								being is when a user see someactor wearing any
								product over posters, ads, and they want to buy
								the same product but there‚Äôs no way they can
								find that over the application, even it becomes
								easier for user to share the product now.
								<span class="green">(Problem Solved)</span>
							</li>
							<li>
								Now on specific product screen, initially all
								details are shown to the user, but there‚Äôs an
								option of hide data through accordion to
								<span class="blue"
									>reduce the load and further
									information.</span

						<ul>

								On the home page, there‚Äôs an option of
								<span class="blue">‚ÄúRecycle‚Äù</span>, now
								sometimes what happened is after buying the
								product user uninstall the application, so
								there‚Äôs a chance to improve the product via sort
								of <span class="blue">gamification</span>, I
								introduced a feature where user can recycle
								thier last buyed frames and in return they would
								get some points which could be redeemed on next
								transactions.
								<span class="green">(Problem Solved)</span>
							</li>
							<li>
								On Recycle screen user can simply upload the
								product image and id, if it got accepted then
								service agent would take that and user would get
								the points.
							</li>
							<li>
								Now, on home screen itself, for buying
								Eyeglasses there could be two options, one of
								them is ‚ÄúCustomisable products‚Äù, reason for
								building this feature is as most of users want
								products that are completely new and match with
								their trends. So, as in the last frame of video,
								user can customize products according to his/her
								needs. But there‚Äôs a constraint, as I‚Äôm not sure
								how much practical is this.

								Here once user decides to buy a particular
								product user would redirect to sign in screen,
								<span class="blue"
									>initially there would be no Sign-In</span
								>
								option, as from my research what I found is
								users drops when we initally asked for their
								information, also in sign in screen there could
								be an option where user can buy products
								<span class="blue">as a guest</span>, to avoid
								any drop-out of users .
							</li>
							<li>
								After Signing-In users can make the payment, I
								make use of breadcrumbs in a way that users can
								see each and every step clearly and tries to
								display every information.
							</li>
							<li>
								Each process is divided into small-small steps
								so that user won‚Äôt find too much load at once.

						The very first thing is I designed things without data,
						designing such a vast application sometimes need a lot
						of data about users, scalability and there could be few
						other things too. So, definitely there are few things
						which I miss out, but I designed things what I got from
						my research and data.
					</li>
					<li>
						Also, being consistent with design is so important, that
						I figured out this thing while doing this case study, as
						sometimes somewhere I used filled icons,somewhere lined
						icons, but while iterating I feel it‚Äôs consistency that
						brings beauty to the design.
					</li>
					<li>
						Next step could be doing testing with users via
						prototype and understanding whether they found it‚Äôs
						usable or not.
