					Initially we had an understanding of what we need to build,
					but we don‚Äôt know what exactly are the needs of our users or
					what are the things that may help us in changing the way
					user thinks about a paid course. So, initially
					<span class="blue"
						>we had a few questions in our mind -
					</span>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						What are the users mental model while buying a paid
						course?
					</li>
					<li>What are their thoughts regarding DSc & ML?</li>
					<li>How can we meet needs of different user groups?</li>
					<li>Are people really interested about DSc & ML?</li>
					<li>What extra values we can provide to the users?</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					We definitely do had a lot more questions, and we know
					research could be the only option to get answer to all those
					questions we had. So, here are the respective steps we
					followed -
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong> Stakeholders Meeting</strong> - This was setup
						to understand the
						<span class="blue">company goals & needs</span>,
						stakeholders do had a larger view and eventually the
						course curriculum is to be prepared by them only, so
						initially clearing doubts from here remain helpful for
						us. From there we got to know about different features
						that we‚Äôre introducing, but to understand better what
						are the user needs, we deep dive into further research.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong> Competitve Research </strong> - Before
						proceding with the user surveys, we analysed what our
						competitors are offering and how can we differentiate
						ourselves from them, we analysed over 12 different
						courses and map them in a sheet. From there, we
						understand the current market trends, here‚Äôs a
						screenshot to that -
					</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="process-image">
					<img
						src="./images/dsc/3.png"
						alt="project process workflow"
					/>
				</div>
				<p class="img-text">
					Hided a few details here and also couldn‚Äôt display the
					overall research due to NDA
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong> Conjoint Analysis </strong> - This is something
						I performed for the very first time, it
						<span class="blue"
							>ask respondents to trade one option for
							another</span
						>. We conducted this to understand which features users
						prefers the most, for ex - ‚ÄúWhether they prefer a
						certificate‚Äù over ‚ÄúExpert Mentors‚Äù or vice-versa. We
						want to do this because, we had many USP‚Äôs to show, but
						highlighting important one, stands us apart from the
						competitors. Here are the points on which we want to
						conduct this -
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>Real data projects</li>
					<li>Network with Alumni from top companies</li>
					<li>Mentorship from top industry mentors and advisors</li>
					<li>Placement Assistance</li>
					<li>Degree from top universities</li>
					<li>Research papers</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="process-image">

				</div>
				<p class="img-text">
					Here‚Äôs how we finally prepared different choices to choose
					from(2nd img) & yes we need to apply Permutaions &
					Combinations(1st img) into it :P
				</p>
				<p>
					I‚Äôll quickly try to explain what we did here, so in this we
					had 6 different choices to ask from the users, accordingly
					we grouped different choices & again grouped them together
					in 3, this way he had a total of 20 groups (user needs to
					choose from a set of 2 choices, 10 times) and by doing so in
					the end we would be having some data, and after calcultions
					we can analyse what are the most important things for a
					user. But
					<span style="color: #da0034"> this method FAILED</span> in
					the end, when we analyse results.
				</p>
				<p>
					This method didn‚Äôt work out well as we expected, we got
					<span class="blue">biased responses</span> from this, due to
					large number of choices people started filling randomly,
					which we got to know after analysing the whole data, thus we
					stopped this and moved further with the user surveys.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li style="margin-bottom: -10px">
						<strong>User Surveys </strong> - So here now we
						conducted a survey from which we received
						<span class="blue">208 responses</span>
						collectively, summary to that is here -
					</li>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>User Group</strong>: A mix or Undergrads and
							working professionals
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Shared on</strong>: Discord, Scaler chat,
							LinkedIn, Instagram

								<li>
									I‚Äôm an Undergraduate Student: 36 (17.3%)

								</li>
								<li>No, Not my cup of tea: 9 (4.3%)</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong
								>Q3. What are the 3 most important features
								while considering a Data-Science course?</strong
							>

							<ul style="margin-top: 0">
								<li>
									Work on Projects created with top companies:
									175 (86.6%)
								</li>
								<li>
									Get Placement assistance at top companies:

								<li>
									Receive certificate from top university: 38
									(18.8%)
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
				<p>
					An upper hand for us as people are actually considering
					learnings and skills over a degree/certificate, also from
					this we got to know people(73%) are really interested in
					learning Data Science & ML.

					Insights from the research
				</h4>
				<p>
					Now after spending a good time on research and finding the
					right information, it‚Äôs time to list down the findings -
				</p>
				<div class="insights-container">
					<div class="one-insight" data-aos="fade-right">
						<h5>1. Practical projects</h5>
						<p>
							We found that, users are very interested in doing
							practical projects, because in Data science, one
							play with large number of data, so user wants the
							data should be real and projects should be taken up
							from real life scenarios, so we tied up with big
							companies like Zomato, Uber etc. to get the real
							data.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="one-insight" data-aos="fade-right">
						<h5>2. Publishing research papers</h5>
						<p>
							One important insight that we found is, users are
							very interested in knowing how to read and publish a
							research paper. Even this is one of the important
							USP, that stand us apart from the competitors. These
							small findings are what that makes a course more
							successful.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="one-insight" data-aos="fade-right">
						<h5>3. Good mentors >>>> Certificates</h5>
						<p>
							Certificates are something that sometimes play an
							important role, especially when it‚Äôs recognised from
							the top universities, but what we found is users
							preffered mentors, instrutcotrs & advisors more than
							a certificate, which is even a good sign how tech
							industry is changing.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="one-insight" data-aos="fade-right">
						<h5>4. Course curriculum is very important</h5>
						<p>
							As this course is for people who‚Äôre already working
							in tech-industry, we found that these people are
							more interested in knowing the curriculum in very
							detail, so we priotised that and had defined the
							curriculum detailed in our design.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="one-insight" data-aos="fade-right">
						<h5>5. Building trust</h5>
						<p>
							One of the major factor that comes before buying any
							course is trust, in research we found that people
							buy more if someone recommends the course to them
							(Mouth-marketing), so we also want to build that
							kind of trust via our course.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					There are some more insights that helps us in moving forward
					, but here I try to highlight the important ones :)

			<section class="section5">
				<p>
					We got some good insights after doing research, now we
					shared the research insights with our stakeholders to get
					their views/feedbacks,
					<span class="blue"
						>asking initial feedback is so much important</span
					>
					at every stage, because it allows us to iterate more and
					deliever better. After this, we need to clearly define
					things and make the right information out of the data we
					collected.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although we‚Äôre targetting only working professionals, but
					under them also we have categorised our users under
					different segements, depending on the their current
					occupation & needs and here are
					<span class="blue">three different personas</span>
					that we created to better understand every user needs and
					their pain points -

				<p class="img-text">
					<span class="blue">Empathising</span> with users is crucial,
					without knowing them by heart building product is difficult
					:)
				</p>
				<p>
					Based on these User persona problems,
					<span class="blue"
						>we laid out solution for each of them</span
					>
					in a sheet, a small view of it can be seen below -
				</p>
				<div class="process-image">
					<img
						src="./images/dsc/9.png"
						alt="project process workflow"
					/>
				</div>
				<p>
					Now we do have some understanding of what a user needs and
					probably how we can provide them, but before jumping into
					building wireframes, we want to define a few metrics for the
					product, so here we used
					<span class="blue">HEART framework</span> to define those
					metrics -

					Here comes one of the interesting part of the whole design
					process, where we started making something for the end user.
					After summarizing overall research we do have an idea of
					what our users want, so we started off with brainstorming,
					<span class="blue"
						>thinking of different structures/layout</span
					>
					to represent the overall data.
				</p>
				<p>
					We first build the <span class="blue">user flow</span>, this
					is based upon how should we integrate the whole Data Science
					program with Scaler products, as we had diff-diff products
					and making a separation from all of them is necessary.
					Here‚Äôs how the flow looks like -
				</p>

				<div class="process-image">
					<img
						src="./images/dsc/12.png"
						alt="project process workflow"
					/>
				</div>
				<p>
					We wanted to build the whole website in a way, that speaks
					up for itself and
					<span class="blue">engage the user via storytelling</span>.
					Considering all these factors, we build some wireframes and
					started with Usability Testings to validate those.
				</p>
				<div class="process-image">
					<img
						src="./images/dsc/13.png"
						alt="project process workflow"
					/>
				</div>
				<p class="img-text">
					These are wireframes we had created
					<span class="blue">after multiple iterations</span>, here
					I‚Äôve divided them itno 3 parts to show the whole design
				</p>
				<p>
					Now after building this, we started with
					<span class="blue">Usability Testing</span>, we reached out
					to sales team to get some folks for the UT‚Äôs. Once we got
					the right users, we mailed & informed them about UT‚Äôs and
					thus proceeded with the same. We don‚Äôt only just test our
					product, but this is more of a
					<span class="blue">talking with the users</span>, as this
					helps in understanding their general needs more, that might
					remain uncover in Research phase.
				</p>
				<div class="process-image">
					<img
						src="./images/dsc/14.png"
						alt="project process workflow"
					/>
				</div>
				<p class="img-text">
					A short glimpse to the Usability Testings we did :)
				</p>
				<p>
					We talked with a total of
					<span class="blue">17 users</span>, who all are
					professionals working at diff organisations. After this, we
					recorded responses of them and analyse all recordings. Major
					findings that we need to work upon -
				</p>
				<div class="insights-container2">
					<div class="one-insight" data-aos="fade-right">
						<h5>Beginner Friendly content</h5>
						<p>
							While doing Usaility Testing‚Äôs we understand, that
							the users also wants to see some beginner friendly
							content, not all visitors coming to the site are pro
							at Data Science. Users wants to see some basic
							blogs, videos etc.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="one-insight" data-aos="fade-right">
						<h5>Small questions format</h5>
						<p>
							We analysed that few of the users, quickly skims
							through content, so we decided to give answers a big
							format, so that they can have a look and read the
							content along.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="one-insight" data-aos="fade-right">
						<h5>Detailed Projects</h5>
						<p>
							Along with a detailed curriculum users wants to see
							the detailed projects as well, according to them a
							good description of projects should be there, it
							helps them to better understand the course.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="one-insight" data-aos="fade-right">
						<h5>Instructors + TA‚Äôs >> Mentor</h5>
						<p>
							So, at Scaler we do have mentors, instructors,
							advisors & TA‚Äôs for the students to help them
							throughout the course. We want to figure out
							acording to students who are most important for
							them, we found that users consider Instructors to be
							more important then a mentor, so this helps us in
							building design accordingly.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div
						class="one-insight"
						style="background-color: #c8ffc7"
						data-aos="fade-right"
					>
						<h5>Average Rating - 8.6</h5>
						<p>
							We asked from users, if you need to rate the work
							(Not visually), then how much you rate that, avergae
							rating comes out to be 8.6.

				<p>
					After finalising the overall structure & flow, we moved out
					on the final work i.e. Visual Design. We first started with
					making our <span class="blue">Design system</span>, as
					previously we don‚Äôt have a universal design system, so this
					is a good chance for us to work on that. For now we‚Äôve
					defined the typography and color palletes that we need to
					use in that, here
					<span class="blue">communicating with dev team</span> is one
					of the very important thing, as the
					<span class="blue">design tokens</span> could be named only
					after the collaboration.
				</p>

				<div class="process-image">
					<img
						src="./images/dsc/16.png"
						alt="project process workflow"

				</div>

				<p>
					Once we have our foundations i.e. - Colors, Typography,
					Grids, spacing, layout & elevation defined, we moved out on
					making necessary components, I used the word
					<span class="blue">necessary</span>
					because, we need to build things fast so at that current
					moment, we don‚Äôt go for building all componets, but one
					those are needed immediately like text-fields, buttons etc.
				</p>
				<p style="margin: 10px 0; margin-bottom: 20px">
					Also deciding a color theme is bit challenging for us, we
					tried mutliple themes and variants, Data-Science course is a
					kind of premium course, as it‚Äôs fees as well as ROI is very
					high, generally ML folks earns a lot in tech indutsry, so we
					want to make sure the overall website gives a
					<span class="blue">premium feeling</span>, thus we decided
					to go with a <span class="blue">dark theme</span> with a
					touch of glassmorphism.

				</p>
				<p>
					After going through all the iterations, we have finallized
					one them and thereafter designed the website by using the
					defined guidelines, as I said earlier we want to make a
					storytelling experience for our users, so rather than
					lisitng all the features we do have, we put them in
					<span class="blue">questions format</span>, as the end goal
					of a person who‚Äôs coming to any website is to
					<span class="blue">solve their respective problems</span>,
					now this way we won‚Äôt only helping getting more leads, but
					we are truly helping our users in finding out for what & why
					they come on our website üòé

					From the Microsoft Clarity and GA (Analytics tool), we saw a

						>larger audience is coming from mobile</span
					>
					as well, so building a good experience for mobile is
					cruciual as same as for the web. Here are the few design
					screens for the mobile users as well -

					After aligning all the stakeholders with the design, we
					collaborated with the dev team to ship pixel perfect design.
					We try to work along the flexbox and grids they‚Äôre using and
					handed off the design with redlines. Few screenshots showing
					the hand off here -

					To make sure we‚Äôre getting the right growth we decided to

				<h4>
					Now the time is for learnings and see where things could be
					improved -
				</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Let‚Äôs first talk about the challenges & mistakes -
						<ul>
							<li>
								We missed the deadlines, yes we did. Having a
								very clear timeline initially help in
								distributing the tasks accordingly.
							</li>
							<li>
								Building components initally. We started with
								building components, but some times we forgot to
								build for ex- header, footer, that causesnew
								problems in the end, when we need to modify
								color or any other part.
							</li>
							<li>
								Getting feedback early & often. It applies to
								every stage of the process whether, it‚Äôs rsearch
								or design. Earlier we collect feedback thebetter
								we can build.
							</li>
							<li>
								Collaborating early with dev. Discussing early
								helps in avoiding any challenges, because there
								might be things that may not be easilydeveloped,
								but we (designers) think in a different way,
								it‚Äôs always better to communicate early.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						There are immense thing we I learned in the overall
						process, talking a few here -
						<ul>
							<li>
								Data helps in making decisions, as we track data
								from the first time itself, it helps us to know
								where we could make changes, that are helpful
								for users
							</li>
							<li>
								Learned how to effectively collaborate with
								different cross-functional team.
							</li>
							<li>
								Started thinking from user perespective‚Äôs,
								during UT calls, I learned how to empathize and
								think from their prespectives
							</li>
							<li>
								Building for all users, we tried to check
								accessiblity at every stage, just to make sure
								we‚Äôre not leaving any users behind us :)
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
