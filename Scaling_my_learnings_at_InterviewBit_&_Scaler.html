				<h1>My Internship Experience at InterviewBit & Scaler</h1>
				<div class="section1-h2"><h2>LEARNINGS & ENJOYMENTS</h2></div>

				<p>
					I had the amazing opportunity to intern at InterviewBit this
					summer in 2021. I was a part of different teams and worked
					on multiple projects from doing Market research to design to
					measuring metrics, I’ve done a lot of things there, which I
					almost loved. My role is not restircted to only design and
					I’m so excited by all the areas of the product, I worked
					upon and see them coming to life.
				</p>
				<p>
					By working closely with the Product managers, Engineers &
					Marketing people the learnings are not about the design now,
					but over the whole ecosystem on how product works. Although
					I can’t share the specifics of the projects here, but I’ll
					try to summarise the things I did. Listing few of the live
					projects, I got a chance to worked upon -
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>InterviewBit Problems page || Check here</li>
					<li>InterviewBit Discussion forum || Check here</li>
					<li>InterviewBit Mock Interview || Check here</li>
					<li>InterviewBit Explore guides || Check here</li>
					<li>Scaler Data Science Program || Check here</li>
				</ul>

				<span class="blue">Featued Projects :</span>
			</h2>
			<br />
			<h3 class="section-heading">
				1. Practice and Problems page for IB - Redesigning the existing
				experience of problems page to increase engagement. Check the
				live page here 🔗
			</h3>
			<section class="section3">
				<p>
					<strong>Problem </strong> : Make it easy for the users to
					practice and solve more questions.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong> Solution</strong>: During my first week, the IB
					team is working on revamping the problems page, and I
					started off gathering the existing research to understand
					the platform and why we’re doing that. After that Yash (One
					of my mentor), Shaurya (PD) and me, we all worked upon
					designing the final product.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					There are multiple iterations that go behind this, we
					conducted various User Testing’s and make changes
					accordingly. Even the very first project here gives me a
					good overview on how to create pixel-perfect designs,
					prepare for the Usability testing and talk with the users
					during the testing :)
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Also, after a few months I worked upon the practice page as
					well, which is a part of IB too, in that I’ve contributed in
					the mobile designs and helped the team in shipping the final
					product.
				</p>

				<h4>Impact :</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Engagement increased from x% to x%</li>
					<li>User started liking the platform</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<h3 class="section-heading">
				2. Discussion forum: Revamping the existing experience of
				practice page to encourage more discussions. Check the live page
				here 🔗
			</h3>
			<section class="section3">
				<p>
					<strong>Problem </strong> : Help users to make fruitful
					conversations and helps them keep engaging with the
					platform.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong> Solution</strong>: As at that time, we’re revamping
					the overall InterviewBit, so most of projects on IB are
					focused on redesigning to achieve newer goals that we had
					set up. This is the project which I took up completely, from
					research to communication to testing. The core focus of
					redesigning things are not only the visual change but to
					solve the problem for users. Currently discussion forum is
					linked with practice page questions as well and we need to
					unify a better flow, to avoid any confusion for our users.

				3. Scaler Data Science: Making a brand new experience for our
				latest product via storytelling. Check the live product here 🔗
			</h3>
			<section class="section3">
				<p>
					<strong>Problem </strong> : How might we reimagine the
					experience of a Data Science course?
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong> Solution</strong>: This was the biggest project I
					worked upon, so I wrote a complete case study over this,
					which you can check here. In this we want to build an
					experience for the users who are interested in Data Science
					and ML, we followed the agile methodology where we iterate
					and take feedback at each step that helps us to launch the
					product from 0-1.

			<h3 class="section-heading">
				4. Design System: Making a single source of truth for both
				developers & designers for better collaboration and
				communication.
			</h3>
			<section class="section3">
				<p>
					<strong>Problem </strong> : How might we tell better
					stories, faster?
				</p>
				<p>
					If you asked me the most interesting project, then I would
					say the Design system one, here I helped the team in
					building design system for all of pur products i.e
					InterviewBit, Scaler (Academy + Data Science + Forever). We
					had a lot of debates upon naming tokens, finalising on how
					to build components, but it was all fun. First we started
					with Why and what is our goal behind design system and laid
					down a strategy on how we can proceed further.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Although we have our foundations (color, typography, grids,
					& spacing) already defined, but those are not easy to use,
					so we first started with building design-tokens for them by
					communicating with the dev team and to land on a decsion
					which will work well for both the teams. Here’s the rough
					process that we followed -
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Establish Goals and KR’s</li>
					<li>Audit the existing product</li>
					<li>Check for incosistencies</li>
					<li>Designing components</li>
					<li>Test</li>
					<li>Dev collaboration & documentation</li>
				</ol>

				<div class="process-image">

				</div>

				<h4>Impact :</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Engagement increased from x% to x%</li>
					<li>User started liking the platform</li>
				</ul>

				<br />
				<p>
					Apart from this there are many learnings & multiple projects
					I worked upon, all of them are unique by themselves and I
					see products going from 0-1 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
				</p>

				</div>

				<h2>Learnings</h2>
				<p>Some of the biggest takeways from my internship -</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Always ask “Why” before anything, understanding scope of
						the project is crucial for building impatcful products.
					</li>
					<li>
						Document everything, I knew the importance of
						documentation, but have never tried it and realised
						after long it’s always best to document along.
					</li>
					<li>
						Make informed decions from data, design choices must
						always be backed by a reason.
					</li>
					<li>
						Design for all users and for a larger ecosystem, it’s
						crucial to consider & follow accessibility guidelines.
					</li>
					<li>
						Build collaborative relationship among team and cross
						functional stakeholders.
					</li>
					<li>
						Involve dev team(even the whole team) from the starting,
						helps build the best product.
					</li>
					<li>
						Not every project comes with a sexy vision, but it still
						serves an important part in User experince.
					</li>
					<li>
						Design is never done, always be curious and ask
						questions :)
					</li>
				</ul>

				<br />
				<p>
					Not only that, I even delieverd a session on Figma and
					Design Systems, it’s always fun to learn and enjoy with all
					🙈 ✨
