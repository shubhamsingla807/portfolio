					<h2>PRODUCT CASE STUDY</h2>

					<h2>ARTICLE</h2>
					<span class="dot">.</span>
					<h2>DESIGN SENSE</h2>
				</div>
				<h2 class="section1-h2-alternate">
					Design challenge UX ResearchUI Design
				</h2>
				<p>
					Hey there , here I‚Äôm jotting an another article related to
					<span class="blue">product management </span>. In this
					article, I‚Äôm first gonna write about how one should answer a
					product design question and then I‚Äôve laid out a process
					that I learned & generally followed while answering these
					kinda questions. So, let‚Äôs get started üòé -
				</p>
				<p>
					First, let‚Äôs talk about why these kinds of questions are
					generally asked? So, basically, it helps the interviewer see
					how one could discover and address the user's pain points
					for a given product. It also helps them in analyzing how
					good one is at making and prioritizing decisions. It‚Äôs also
					done to identify one's thought process & communication
					skills.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are various framework to answer these kind of
					questions, one of the popular framework is
					<span class="blue">CIRCLES method</span>, but for this we‚Äôre
					not exactly using this framework, we‚Äôre modifying it a bit
					according to our requirements. Here‚Äôs our process -
				</p>

				<div class="lists">
					<div>
						<ol>
							<li>Clarify the scope of the question.</li>
							<li>Mission/Vision of the product</li>
							<li>Define personas (User group)</li>
							<li>Define user journe¬≠y</li>
							<li>Identify user problems</li>
							<li>List solutions & evaluate them</li>
							<li>Define success metrics</li>
							<li>Summarising the whole case</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="process-image">

				</div>
			</section>

			<section id="section2" class="section2">
				<h2>
					1 & 2. Clarifying the scope of the question and state
					Mission of the product
				</h2>
				<p>
					The very first thing one should do is to clarify and ask
					more questions, here either the interviewer answers our
					questions or we need to make assumptions while giving valid
					reasons why we make them. Now, stating Mission is sometimes
					important especially when we‚Äôre introducing a new feature to
					an existing application, because there should be WHY first
					before building any product, if we‚Äôre introducing something
					new that doesn‚Äôt match with our vision, then we should think
					before building that feature or product.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section class="section3">
				<p>
					In this given question it‚Äôs asking to design NETFLIX for
					senior citizens, now interviewer had not given us a broad
					statement, to make sure we‚Äôre solve the right problem, one
					should ask basic questions in the beginning, so for the
					given example, these could be -
				</p>
				<ul style="list-style: none; margin-left: 0">
					<li>
						<span class="bold">
							Q1. Are we targeting any particular age group?</span
						>
						‚Äî Consider seniors above 60 years of age.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="bold"
							>Q2. What is the goal of the product?</span
						>
						‚Äî Increase Engagement.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="bold"
							>Q3. Old people had generally various disabilities
							(one of the common ones that may affect our product
							is low-eyesight), should we consider these
							disabilities?</span
						>- Yes
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="bold"
							>Q4. Is this would be a separate product or would be
							a part of the existing application ?</span
						>- You Decide
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="bold"
							>Q5. For which platform are we designing for Web or
							Mobile?</span
						>
						‚Äî You Decide
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Now after asking the right questions, we do have a clear
					idea about the product, so
					<span class="blue">reiterating the statement</span> here‚Äî
					Design Netflix for senior citizens above the age of 60 years
					and they may or may not have disabilities. Our goal is to
					increase user engagement. The product could be built for any
					device and it‚Äôs up to me whether I should build a new one or
					make changes to the existing one. Also, here assumption I‚Äôm
					taking is senior people know how to use smart devices and
					have a little bit of tech knowledge.
				</p>
				<p>
					Coming to the mission part, Netflix's mission is to
					<span class="blue">‚ÄúEntertain the world‚Äù</span>, which
					definitely fits here. Also, there‚Äôs a reason behind why
					should we build this - As senior citizens generally had a
					lot of free time and hence we can develop an engaging
					platform for them that eventually leads to more revenue.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="section2" class="section2">
				<h2>3. Define personas (User group)</h2>
				<p>
					The next step that comes is to define all users who gonna be
					the future/current users of the product. Remember, sometimes
					user & customer might not be the same, for example in
					education apps for kids, the childrens are the users but
					parents are the one who are the customer, at that time we
					should focus on both the users and define why we are
					choosing them.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section class="section3">
				<p>For now, we could have different user groups -</p>
				<ul style="list-style: none; margin-left: 0">
					<li>
						<span class="bold">New joiners </span>- Senior citizens
						who just got to know about Netflix.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="bold">Daily Watchers</span>- Seniors who
						already watch different TV shows (Uncle John, who‚Äôs 63
						years old & loved watching comedy shows).
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="bold">Occasional watchers</span>- Seniors
						who occasionally watch TV shows (Aunt Bella, who
						sometimes does watch cooking episodes).
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Under these there could be various personas, but for now I
					would like to focus on New joiners as this could be our new
					target and if we solve the problem for them, then obviously
					our problem got solved for the rest of the groups as well,
					as the remaining journey after joining Netflix would almost
					be similar.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section id="section2" class="section2">
				<h2>4 & 5. Defining user journey & identifying pain points</h2>
				<p>
					Now after a clear understanding of our target user groups,
					the time comes to see how a journey looks to be from a user
					point of view. Laying out user journey is important because
					it eliminates the chances of missing any pain point. In the
					whole journey, there could be various pain points, but
					making sure we‚Äôre aligning them towards our goal is also
					cruicial.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section class="section3">
				<p>
					Here laying out the <span class="blue">journey</span> for
					our Netflix user -
				</p>
				<p style="margin: 10px 0">
					Senior starts his day -> Feels free and have nothing much to
					do -> Senior feels bored and got to know about Netflix ->
					Opens Netflix application -> Choose Language -> Sign in ->
					Pay -> Browse/Search relevant content or watch from
					reccomendations -> Play video ->Finish or may not finish ->
					Come back again -> Wants to be reminded which show they were
					watching -> Start watching again
				</p>
				<p>
					Based on the user journey we can identify the user problems
					and then prioritize and find solutions for them -
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The user might have difficulty in onboarding.</li>
					<li>The user doesn‚Äôt know what to watch.</li>
					<li>
						The user won‚Äôt able to read properly any content if s/he
						wants to, due to low eye vision.
					</li>
					<li>
						The user might have low retention memory, so a user
						won‚Äôt able to remember the last episode if s/he drops in
						while watching a video.
					</li>
					<li>The user might forget to watch the TV series.</li>
					<li>
						Once a series/show is finished s/he doesn‚Äôt know what to
						do next.
					</li>
					<li>
						The user might get bored in between while watching
						Netflix shows.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					I have listed down all the problems which I feel a user
					might face while using or exploring the product, now most of
					the problems seem important to solve, but for now, to build
					the MVP, I would be focusing on
					<span class="blue">2,3,4 & 5</span> , reason being is as all
					these are more focused towards
					<span class="blue">engagement</span> which is our main goal.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section id="section2" class="section2">
				<h2>6. List solutions & evaluate them</h2>
				<p>
					Now we have figured out the gaps, time has come to start
					brainstorming and listing out creative and practical
					solutions for the same. Once we find the solutions one of
					the important steps is to again prioritize the solutions, as
					deciding which feature to roll out at what time is another
					major function. Also, don't be afraid to ask the interviewer
					if we are on the right track or if they prefer us to focus
					on another ideas.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section class="section3">
				<p>
					But before directly jumping into the solution, let us first
					decide two things i.e. This product would be a
					<span class="blue">mobile application</span> although there
					would be an option for users to
					<span class="blue"
						>watch them easily either on their tablet or TV</span
					>
					(As for senior users, holding or watching something in a
					phone would be difficult considering their disabilities).
					Second is we won‚Äôt be creating any new application for that,
					this one could be
					<span class="blue">implemented in the existing one</span>.
					(Although there could be trade-offs for the same which we‚Äôll
					discuss in the end). So, for now, here I would list some
					solutions for the above problems and have prioritized them
					in this table -
				</p>
				<div class="img-container">
					<img src="./images/project3Table.png" alt="" />
					<p style="font-size: 0.8rem; margin-top: -8px">
						Note : Here we could use the
						<span class="blue">RICE framework</span> as well, to
						priortise the solution
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					For our MVP we could focus on the features that are listed
					as <span class="blue">‚ÄúMust have‚Äù</span> and can build a
					product according to them. Also now let‚Äôs discuss the pros
					and cons of
					<span class="blue">modifying the existing application</span>
					for these new users as we discussed above -
				</p>
				<p>Pros -</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						No need to put more effort into building a new
						application.
					</li>
					<li>
						Need less effort to push, don‚Äôt need to spend more money
						on marketing/acquire customers, etc.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Cons -</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Not helpful for existing customers, make it cluttered.
					</li>
					<li>
						Targeting all segments would be difficult to handle.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Considering these for now we could go with modifying the
					existing application and can think of building a new one in
					V2.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section id="section2" class="section2">
				<h2>7 & 8. Define metrics & summarising the whole case</h2>
				<p>
					After listing the solutions, the next thing that comes is to
					list down metrics that we need to measure, as before
					launching it in the market, we should track are we aligning
					them with our goal or not. Now the final and the last thing
					is just to summarize the the work that we did.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section class="section3 section7">
				<p>Overall metrics that we are going to measure are -</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Total number of downloads (Acquisition)</li>
					<li>
						Total number of active users who made payment and select
						themselves as senior citizens (Activation)
					</li>
					<li>
						Total number of users using accessibility features (Text
						& voice)
					</li>
					<li>
						Total number of users watching shows from the
						recommendations as compared to search
					</li>
					<li>Total number of users watching the recap</li>
					<li>
						Total number of users coming back to the application
						after sending a notification
					</li>
					<li>Avg session duration (Engagement)</li>
					<li>Total number of sessions (Engagement)</li>
					<li>
						Total number of users coming back to the application
						(Retention)
					</li>
					<li>Average revenue generated per user (Revenue)</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					There comes the ending part, now from identifying the
					problems to listing metrics we have done everything, in the
					end, we can tell the interviewer summary of the whole study,
					and yup we‚Äôre done üòé.
				</p>
				<p>
					IMP ‚Äî As a PM we won‚Äôt only measure the growth for a company
					but also see
					<span class="blue">how it‚Äôs affecting the users</span>,
					maybe we can implement a feature where if a particular user
					watches more than 2 hours in a single day then we can push a
					notification stating it‚Äôs time to take rest because as a
					senior citizen
					<span class="blue"
						>continuously watching a screen may have bad side
						effects.</span
					>

				<h2>Learning</h2>
				<p style="font-weight: bolder">
					Here are the things that I learned while writing this
					article
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Understanding ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù first is far more important than
						‚ÄúWhat‚Äù & ‚ÄúHow‚Äù.
					</li>
					<li>
						Asking preliminary questions helps us in setting a clear
						path and to focus on a particular goal.
					</li>
					<li>
						Making sure we‚Äôre aligning with our goal while
						proceeding is another major aspect of the whole process.
					</li>
					<li>
						If we miss any use case, we miss a pain point,
						understading how it looks to be in a user shoe is
						crucial as well.
					</li>
					<li>
						While this is not a real interview, but checking along
						with the interviewer at each step helps us to stay on
						the right path.
