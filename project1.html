					As initially for every project I ask few research questions
					from myself to better understand the context. Here are some
					questions I wanted to get answers by the end of this project
					-
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Why does mentorship matters?</li>
					<li>Why do we need a mentor?</li>
					<li>
						Why should a mentor guide you/invest time in someone?
					</li>
					<li>From where do we find a mentor?</li>
					<li>How could one believe in anyone‚Äôs advice?</li>
					<li>
						How a mentee would get to know whether this mentor is
						good for him/her or not?
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					<strong>Surveys ‚Äî </strong> Now, after knowing few of things
					I moved to <span class="blue">conducting a survey</span> , I
					floated a Google form among my peers, in 1 day I got only
					responses from around 20 students, unfortunately in this
					those who fills the form are only mentees. As I don‚Äôt want
					to wait much to get more responses, as it‚Äôs
					<span class="blue">timed challenge</span>, so I focused more
					on <span class="blue">1-1 interview</span>, in which I
					talked with 4 students who seek mentorship and 2 mentors who
					want to provide mentorship.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					<strong>Semi-Structured Interviews - </strong> Talking
					directly with users give me much
					<span class="blue"
						>more insights about what they want and what are their
						pain points.</span
					>
					As I mentioned above my main focus was here to get more &
					more insights as I didn‚Äôt get much value from the survey,
					although I got to know about their needs through it. But
					still, I want to know more about their pain points, as my
					whole solution would based on that only.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					<strong>Market Research - </strong> This is one of
					interesting thing I like to do, I explore different
					applications already existing in the market, also read and
					analyze data from different sources to validate some of my
					assumptions that I made. Doing secondary research provides
					me some new information that sometimes misses in a 1-1
					interview or surveys. Some of the market findings -
				</p>

				<div class="research-container">
					<div class="one-research">
						<img src="./images/tinder.png" alt="tinder" />
						<h4>Tinder</h4>
						<p>
							Tinder is not exactly a competitor but, it helps in
							providing some value how it helps its users to match
							with each other without even knowing them, what‚Äôs
							the motivation behind users that makes them use the
							application.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="one-research">
						<img src="./images/linkedin.png" alt="linkedin" />
						<h4>LinkedIn</h4>
						<p>
							LinkedIn is somewhat related to the context, but not
							exactly, it‚Äôs main focus was not onto helping mentee
							to find mentors, but users can request other people
							to be their mentor, so I thought of understanding
							its features and applications too.

					Now I got the data from the research but that data is not
					categorized in a proper way to make the information. So, to
					make the information out of data, I made personas and state
					the problems that I understood from the research.
				</p>

				<h4>Some of the research insights that i found -</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Following Up with each other after one call is
						difficult, especially when you‚Äôre first time meeting the
						mentor.
					</li>
					<li>
						Mentorship should feel natural, it‚Äôs not like answering
						one or two questions but it‚Äôs more about guiding the
						mentee through the whole process.
					</li>
					<li>
						Everyone specially mentee should value time of each &
						everyone.
					</li>

						<h3>Mentor Persona</h3>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h4>Problems from Mentors -</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						It‚Äôs hard to connect with someone having no common
						value, interests and majors.
					</li>
					<li>
						It‚Äôs little difficult to maintain work life and devoting
						time to mentoring.
					</li>
					<li>
						As of now there‚Äôs no common platform where mentees can
						schedule meets and chat.
					</li>
					<li>
						It‚Äôs hard to share things that are common to some
						mentees, teaching same thing again on 1-1 is tedious.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Problems from Mentees -</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Sometimes after choosing a mentor, there‚Äôs no way to go
						back and cancel any meeting, in case mentee doesn‚Äôt like
						the mentor.
					</li>
					<li>
						Similarly as of now there‚Äôs no common platform where
						user can seek mentorship from mentors.
					</li>
					<li>
						If sometimes got a chance to get mentorship from mentor,
						then time doesn‚Äôt match with each other schedule.

					Here comes the most interesting and one of my favourite part
					i.e. brainstorming, in this I try to generate as much as
					ideas possible, and then choosing the best from it. In this
					first time I perform the
					<span class="blue">Crazy8‚Äôs activity</span> and it really

					The very first thing is choosing the right color and then
					the right typeface beause it‚Äôs the color and font that makes

					For Typeface I choose

								Here firstly I designed the splash screen for

							</li>

								While onboarding I divide the questions in three

								<span class="blue">don‚Äôt feel confused</span> by
								seeing lot of questions.
								<span class="green">(Problem Solved)</span>
							</li>
							<li>
								In the last I try to ask unformal questions as

								QnA‚Äôs and even see the answers or ask some

								screen is to <span class="blue">answer common questions</span> with in a
								QnA itself, as it would save mentor time to
								answer the same things again & again. <span class="green">(Problem

							</li>

								Again on home screen there could be several

								users, as of now I had just shown the
								recommended mentors.

								In Second frame, it shows the <span class="blue">filtering option</span>,
								where user can easily filter the mentors
								according to his/her requirements. <span class="green">(Problem
								Solved)</span>
							</li>
							<li>
								In next frame, a mentee can see mentor‚Äôs profile
								and even on tapping more information would
								appear, but I try not to make that screen due to
								time limitations.
							</li>
							<li>
								When user clicks on Send Request, it would ask

								First frame basically shows the Chat screen, a
								mentor would directly <span class="blue">come into chat only if he
								accepted the mentee request</span> and after chatting
								with the mentor, user can check his availability
								and book a session according to it.
							</li>
							<li>
								Second frame shows the <span class="blue">calendar</span>, in which a user
								can see his/her upcoming session accordingly to
								the date, even user can reschedule/cancel the
								session if s/he needs to do that easily.
							</li>
							<li>
								For checking availability with a particular
								mentor there would be a simple option to send
								availability button from mentor side which he
								can send in the chat screen itself, so that
								mentee can just directly click on that and see
								his/her <span class="blue">availability</span> as shown in fourth frame.
								<span class="green">(Problem Solved)</span>
							</li>
							<li>
								After clicking on that button user can book a
								slot and see the charges for each class (here
								the <span class="blue">assumption</span> I‚Äôm taking is every mentor would
								have same charge for 15/30/60 min calls), as for
								booking a pack of sessions (as mentioned in the
								problem statement) what I think is user can
								directly buy a <span class="blue">subscription model</span> in which user
								can select 4/8/12 calls package according to the
								need.
							</li>
							<li>
								Buying that <span class="blue">subscription model</span> would help user
								in two ways, one is low cost, other is user can
								book multiple sessions with different -
								different mentors just by paying once which
								improves the experience.
							</li>
							<li>
								Now to inform the user that we had subscription
								model too, we can <span class="blue">show the pop up</span> once user try
								to click on ‚ÄúBook a call‚Äù as shown in last frame
								and accordingly user can buy any subscription.

								For the mentor most of the screens would be same

							<li>
								So, in the first frame a mentor can review
								request of mentees s/he can either accept or

							<li>
								In the second screen like a mentee, mentor can

					Phew, after a continuous hard work, I learn some beautiful

					<li>
						One of the learning is while conducting surveys if it
